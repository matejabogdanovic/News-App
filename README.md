# News App

News App is a dynamic React application that serves as an online newspaper, offering news across multiple categories.

Users can browse through various sections, while administrators have the ability to add new articles through a dedicated interface.

**Note that this is only a frontend practice app, so I used JSON Server to simulate a backend, and there is no authentication.**

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matejabogdanovic/News-App.git

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```sh
cd News-App
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Use npm to install the required packages:

```sh

```

### 4. Run the application

Start the development server in one terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

In a second terminal, start the JSON server:

```sh
